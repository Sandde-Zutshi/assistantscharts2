## We explore the Code Completion tool from OpenAI's Assistants API to create visualizations directly from data


This folder contains the code and data to support the article above - in particular, it implements a Streamlit app based on the original code (see parent folder).


## Description and files

We explore chart creation using OpenAI's Assistants and Code Interpreter.

_Files_

- the main Streamlit app code is in the file `app.py`
- ``world_cf.csv`` is the data file
- ``meals2.csv`` is a data file
- ``asst_utils.py`` is an implementation of the original Jupter Note code in the form of a library class.
- ``.streamlit`` this folder does not exist in the repo but should be present and contain a Streamlit secrets file that contains a vaild OpenAI API key
