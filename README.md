## We explore the Code Completion tool from OpenAI's Assistants API to create visualizations directly from data


This folder contains the code and data to support the article above.


## Description and files

We explore chart creation using OpenAI's Assistants and Code Interpreter.

_Files_

- the main code is in the file `codeinterpreter.ipynb`
- ``world_cf.csv`` is the data file
- ``show_data.ipynb`` is simply so that I could get a screenshot of the dataframe
- the `.png` files are the output from the code.
